<strong>Redirect</strong> is created to deal with QR codes that possibly could change in the future. Make the QR code to the URL where you are hosting your <strong>Redirect</strong> app. If the URL needs to change last minute, can change the URL in the app to redirect to the change.

QR code URL is this repo and will redirect you to google.com
